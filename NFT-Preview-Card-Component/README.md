## My process


### Built with


- HTML5 markup, as semantic as possible.
- CSS custom properties.
- Flexbox.
- Only one vertical margin!


### What I learned


* Should've looked up the image hover overlay with icon solution and explanation faster than I did.

* Flexbox is almost always > vertical margin.
