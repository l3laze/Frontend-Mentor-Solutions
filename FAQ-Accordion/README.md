## My process


### Built with


- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned


It's extremely annoying trying to build to the design based on a blurry JPG. Hard to tell if some of the text has a shadow or if it's just aliasing.

## Acknowledgments


Thanks to Frontend Mentor's own accordion in their help section. Despite the obfuscated CSS it was still worth inspecting with dev tools.
